What is HomeScrew?

Homescrew is a lightweight alternative to homebrew.
It is build for windows, and windows only.

I plan to first make an opensource batch version of the program,
and than write an alternative in python. (also opensource off course)

I hope to also make a big download link database that can be updated
by all users, after confirmation by dev.
